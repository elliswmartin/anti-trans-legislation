Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina:
<p>
SECTION&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Section 45-9-10 of the 1976 Code is amended by adding:
<p>
&quot;(D)(1)&nbsp; &nbsp; As used in this subsection:
<p>
(a)&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Biological sex' means the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate.
<p>
(b)&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Multiple occupancy bathroom' or 'changing facility' means a facility designed or designated to be used by more than one person at a time where persons may be in various states of undress in the presence of other persons. A multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility may include, but is not limited to, a restroom, locker room, changing room, or shower room.
<p>

<p>
(2)&nbsp; &nbsp; Units of local government in this State may not enact local laws, ordinances, orders, or other regulations that require a place of public accommodation or a private club or other establishment not in fact open to the general public to allow a person to use a multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility regardless of the person's biological sex. A local law, ordinance, order, or other regulation enacted by a unit of local government to require a person to use a multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility designated for his biological sex is not a violation of this chapter and does not constitute discrimination based upon a protected category.
<p>
(3)&nbsp; &nbsp; This section does not apply to persons entering a multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility designated for use by the opposite sex:
<p>
(a)&nbsp; &nbsp; for custodial purposes;

<p>
(f)&nbsp; &nbsp; that has been temporarily designated for use by that person's biological sex.&quot;
<p>
