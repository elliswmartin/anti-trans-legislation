Public schools in this State have a duty to protect the dignity, health and welfare of the students in their care. Allowing students to use restrooms, locker rooms, and showers that are reserved for students of a different sex will create a significant potential for disruption of school activities and unsafe situations. Allowing students to use restrooms, locker rooms, and showers that are reserved for students of a different sex will create potential embarrassment, shame, and psychological injury to students.
